# King Street Toronto
An investigation into the violations of restricted traffic movements in the King Street Transit Priority Corridor of Toronto.

## Background
The King Street Transit Priority Corridor started as the King Street Pilot Project in Fall of 2017 to improve transit reliability, speed, and capacity by giving priority to streetcars over private vehicles. The King Street Pilot Project was approved by City Council on July 4, 2017, and was launched November 12, 2017, expecting to operate for one year, and was granted an extension to July 31, 2019. On April 16, 2019, City Council made the King Street Pilot Project permanent as the King Street Transit Priority Corridor. 

The Corridor spans the length of King St from Bathurst St in the west to Jarvis St in the east. There are several traffic rules that were put into place for private vehicles travelling in the Corridor, most of which are described [here](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/planning-studies-initiatives/king-street-pilot/how-to-use-the-king-street-transit-pilot/). A more detailed description of the restrictions can be found [here](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/8ead-King-Street-Brochure_May2018_Web.pdf). These traffic restrictions are what allows the Corridor to prioritize transit (the King Street 504 streetcar).

## Initial Successes and Impacts
The initial successes and impacts of the King Street Pilot/Transit Priority Corridor are well documented in the [dashboard-style reports](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/planning-studies-initiatives/king-street-pilot/data-reports-background-materials/) published by the City of Toronto, in cooperation with TTC. The project decreased transit travel time, and increased streetcar speed, reliability, and ridership. TTC added more service and streetcar capacity to the 504 route as a response to the project's success. There was also increased cycling volumes and pedestrian volumes on King. Car volumes on King were decreased, and while there was some increase to traffic volume on nearby parallel street, there was minimal impact to travel times on those streets (Queen/Richmond/Adelaide/Wellington). Overall, the King Street Transit Priority Corridor was considered a success, and was even modelled after in New York City for 14th Street. 

## Media Reporting
In the past year, there has been increased media attention on the deterioration of the King Street Transit Priority Corridor, as a look at the redesign of King Street 5 years on. Citizens, local advocates, and city councillors have put forward concerns regarding the lack of maintenance of the Corridor's infrastructure, and the lack of enforcement of traffic restrictions. 

### Infrastructure
People have observed that the Corridor's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair. Many articles describe the worn-down and neglected appearance of the fixtures of the Corridor, such as bollards being flattened or missing, yellow warning strips damaged or remove, and some seating areas are gone. Although there is no clear explanation for the lack of maintenance of the Corridor's infrastructure, it has been reported that the fixtures were not meant to be permanent when initially installed for the King Street Pilot, which is why they have fallen apart 5-6 years later. The city is waiting to revamp the transit stops in the Corridor and make other streetscape changes as they want to coordinate with other private streetscape reconstruction, and reportedly has planned streetscape improvements for 2023 with streetcar track repairs. Overall, people are frustrated and discouraged to observe the lack of care for the infrastructure, seeing the state of the Corridor as a signal that the city does not mean what it says or take care of what was invested in. 

### Enforcement
In the summer of 2019, CBC News reported observations of the first few years of the King Street Pilot. Many drivers were disobeying the traffic restriction signs, even though fines are $110 a ticket and two demerit points. From November 2017 to July 2019, the 21-month period of the King Street Pilot until it became permanent, Toronto Police had issued 16,000 tickets for the Corridor, with the biggest culprit being out-of-town drivers. Police say that while the perception is that there isn't enough enforcement, in actuality the Corridor is covered by three divisions. The city and police are interested in automated enforcement cameras to maintain enforcement in the area, but this is not possible as it requires the province to provide legislative authority. In 2019, MTO was still developing a regulatory framework for the implementation of automated speed enforcement. Notably, New York City's emulation of the King Street Transit Priority Corridor on their 14th Street implements automated enforcement cameras to great effect. 

In 2022 and 2023, the public perception of the enforcement of the King Street traffic restrictions is still that there is not enough enforcement of the rules of the Corridor, and that it appears that more drivers are ignoring signage and not facing any repercussions. Pedestrians have observed drivers breaking the rules in the Corridor, and Toronto Police say there is a general lack of interest in following traffic rules across the city. Toronto Police have competing priorities and cannot constantly patrol the Corridor, but tickets on King Street are still being issued. From January to March 17, 2023, 1852 tickets were issued in the Corridor for disobeying traffic signs, including provincial offence notices, offence summons for drivers with multiple driving convictions, and written warnings. The Corridor's city councillor and public transit advocates are demanding explanations for the car traffic in the Corridor, and emphasize a need to revisit the redesign of King Street, calling on the city and police to do their part. They feel that the Transit Priority Corridor is no longer a priority for the city, and that King Street is just like any other street again. 


## introduce traffic volume data
we are investigating how many drivers are breaking the rules of the corridor

investigating traffic volume data for restricted movements in the King Street Transit Priority Corridor

The restrictions and violations that we are investigating are in regards to private vehicles, and how they move at intersections of the Corridor. Namely, vehicles are not supposed to drive through the Bathurst or Jarvis intersections on King but can turn left or right off of King, through traffic on King not allowed at any of the intersections in the Corridor, and no left turns on King at signalized intersections in the Corridor. In reality, some intersections do allow for through traffic because they are oneway streets (Simcoe, York), but for others it is less clear (John, Bay). 

with aggregated traffic volume data was collected by the City of Toronto at several intersections from Bathurst to Jarvis on King St (see table below). 

| UID |    Intersection   |
|:--:|:-----------------:|
| 10 |  King / Bathurst  |
| 11 |  King / Portland  |
| 12 |   King / Spadina  |
| 13 |    King / Peter   |
| 32 |    King / John    |
| 14 |   King / Simcoe   |
| 15 | King / University |
| 16 |    King / York    |
| 17 |     King / Bay    |
| 18 |    King / Yonge   |
| 19 |   King / Church   |
| 20 |   King / Jarvis   |



Taxi vehicles are allowed through intersections between 10pm and 5am, and thus our data analysis will not include traffic volume data from those time periods, as there is no differentiation in the data between a private vehicle and a taxi.

### pilot volumes

## corridor being made permanent in 2019
- completeness of 2019 data, present all intersections
- avg violations per day by intersection

### post-permanency volumes 2020-2023
- as some intersections' sensors were decommissioned, major intersections only
- covid patterns
- slow increase in traffic volume
- thru vs left, E approach vs W approach

## future investigations
